Lecture Application Development for iOS and Android:
In this lecture we developed in a team of three students our first little app in Android Studio (Java) and xCode (Swift).

CarPark App

With this app you can check out carparks in the city of Stuttgart.
You see them on the Google Map and you can click on a marker of a carpark to get all the important information about parking there.
In addition you can see how far the carpark is from your personal location.
In the actionbar there is a location icon where you can click to see your current location and nearby carparks.
This app should help you to easily find parking lots near your location and to get the information you need to decide whether you want to park in the carpark or not.

Information of the carparks:
Name
Address
Opening Hours
Total Places
Tariff
